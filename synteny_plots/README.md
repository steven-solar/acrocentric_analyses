Used to generate synteny plots in fig2 and supplement. First need to rename chromosomes so that the scripts don't get confused later on, since many will have the same name, append the species and hap to it. Also invert HSA9 and HSAY in chimp bonobo to match direction. wfmash all the primary haplotypes of each chromosome (ie. all of pri HSA9 across the apes) with 50kb seed size for mashmap. Then concatenate these pafs together to get the all pairs. Then run SVbyEye on these to get the plots. The mini plots are based on the 1-1 alignment of chromosomes, and edited in AI.
