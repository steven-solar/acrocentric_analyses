First, in `mashmap_heatmaps` run `run.sh`, this will kick off all the mashmaps between chromosomes. Every chromosome for each species is mashmapped to every other chromosome in that same species via `mashmap.sh` in 10kb chunks with at least 80% identity. Then `get_bed.py` converts these into heatmap beds by converting percent identity to a RGB color along the Rd-Or-Yl spectrum.

Then in `define_PHRs` , `summarize_all.sh` iterates over the mashmaps (its quite slow) and summarizes the shared sequence between all pairs of chromosomes in all species where shared sequence is defined at being a mashmap hit of at least 90% identity. It first does this for all sequence, then filters out censats, then filters out censats, telomeres, and subtelomeres. It counts total bp shared and the avg %id of those bases. It then generates the graphs found in the PHR figure of the paper with that data. Line width is based on normalized bp shared, color is based on average %identity. `get_PHRs.sh` just filters for >99% id  in those heatmap BEDs and merges intervals to get a BED file of all the PHRs.

The *.tsv in this top level dir contain all the relationships between all chroms for all apes.
